- This is implementation of oauth 2.0 server as defined in [rfc6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.txt) and [rfc8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.txt).
- It is a minimalistic implementation that implements most common use cases, suitable for testing code that depends on oauth servers
- It can be simply deployed as a docker container along with other service that depend on oauth server.
- The data directory can be configured via environment variable NGAUTH_DATA
- The private key for the server can be supplied via NGAUTH_KEY
- The project uses node.js with express.
- Coding style is Standard JS, using standard package.
- Always use stanard fix before commiting and pushing code.
- Code should be minimalistic, fail-fast, rely on errors rather than on excessive condition checks.
- It uses JWT for authentication tokens
- It supports scopes
- It supports client credentials
- jwks is served at /.well-known/jwks.json
- simple html support at /authorize endpoint
- Docker container can run without any configuration, in which case it generates and persists a newly generated key in NGAUTH_DATA directory.

  - TToken Endpoint (/token) - §3.2
  - Client Authentication at token endpoint - §3.2.1
